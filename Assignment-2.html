Q1. What are the differences between var, let and const.

Ans1. In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables, but they have some
 key differences in terms of scope, hoisting, and reassignment.

 var: Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means they are only visible
within the function where they are declared. If declared outside any function, the 
variable becomes a global variable.

let and const: Variables declared with let and const are block-scoped. Block scope means
the variable is only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) where it is
declared. This includes if statements, loops, and any other block structures.

Q2. Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NAN.

Ans2. Undefined: When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it is automatically
 assigned the value undefined.

Not defined: If you try to access a variable that has not been declared, JavaScript will
 throw a ReferenceError, indicating that the variable is not defined. 

NAN: NaN is a special value in JavaScript representing "Not a Number." It is a result of
invalid or undefined mathematical operations, such as dividing zero by zero or attempting
to parse a non-numeric string as a number.

Q3. What is the difference between null and undefined and where to use what?

Ans3. Undefined: A variable that has been declared but has not been assigned any value
 automatically has the value undefined.

Null: null is an assignment value that represents the intentional absence of any object
 value. It is often used to explicitly indicate that a variable, object property, or 
 function argument should have no value or no reference. 

 We use undefined when a variable is naturally without a value, such as when declared but
not assigned.
And we use null to explicitly indicate the absence of a value, typically as a placeholder
for an object that might be assigned later.

Q4. What is execution context?

Ans4. In JavaScript, an execution context is an abstract concept that encompasses all the
necessary information to manage the execution of code. It includes variables, functions,
and the scope chain, which defines how variables and functions are accessed in the code.
Every time code is executed, it is done within a specific execution context.

There are three types of execution contexts in JavaScript:

1. Global Execution Context
2. Function Execution Context
3. Eval Execution Context

Q5. What is the use of prompt in JavaScript?

Ans5. The prompt function in JavaScript is used to interact with the user by displaying a
dialog box that prompts them to enter some information. prompt function can be intrusive,
 and its use is often considered less user-friendly. The entered data is always returned as
a string, so if numeric input is expected, it may need to be converted using functions 
like parseInt or parseFloat.

Q6. Why JavaScript is Dynamic language?

Ans6. JavaScript is often referred to as a dynamic language due to its dynamic typing and
dynamic behavior during runtime. The dynamic nature of JavaScript contributes to its
versatility and makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from web development
to server-side programming and beyond.
